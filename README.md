# Blob-Tracking-TouchDesigner
This project is an interactive blob tracking interface built in TouchDesigner that processes live images in real time and translates them into responsive visuals. The system uses blob tracking to identify and follow movement within a live camera feed, mapping detected shapes and positions by combining mathematical operators and geometric CHOPs.
